			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<b><p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p></b>
				<p>The code I started with was from a website about audio visualization in JavaScript with p5.js. I looked into the code and used it as a starting point. 
				</p>
				<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/3d-sine-cosine-in-3d.html">Sine/Cosine Example</a> and
				<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/veroalfaro/sketches/HyiJWqK57">Sphere Example</a>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<B><p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p></B>
				<p>I tried to copy the code of the sine/cosine link and make another formation of spheres. I did this by creating a helix version of the sine/cosine to make it look like DNA.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<b><p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p></b>
				<p>I tried to change the sine/cosine code at first but it was hard to create a moving representation of a double helix (DNA). As my innovation I wanted to represent a DNA strand so instead I worked from the ground up and used the sphere example to start from 1 object and build up. I built the double helix all by myself in the end and learned a lot through trying to visually represent it. Even though I did not end up getting a moving visual representation of the double helix I am still really proud of how it ended up and the interaction that you can have with the 3D DNA strand. </p>
			
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<b><p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p></b>
				<ul>
					<b><li>What part of the project you contributed</li></b>
					<ul><li> All created by Lukas Licon with inspiration from the code linked <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/3d-sine-cosine-in-3d.html">here</a> and <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/veroalfaro/sketches/HyiJWqK57">here</a>.</li></ul>
					<b><li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li></b>
					<ul><li>I love the work that I did and im happy with how it ended up even though I didn't end up figuring out how to create a moving visual represenation that broke apart and came back together rather than just a rotating visual representation.</li></ul>
					<b><li>Brief highs and lows</li></b>
					<ul><li>I had a low when I tried to break apart the helix and move around the spheres and then move them back to a moving positon that is constrained along a path. I ended up scrapping this idea and making the double helix interactable with a bunch of buttons. I had another low trying to make shaders and spent about an entire day custom coding them just to scrap it because it was too hard to debug. </li>
					<li>
						I had a high when I stopped trying to break apart the helix and instead interact with it through buttons because then I had some really cool emergent interaction within my browser with the buttons. I had all types of cool art from changing the variables and updating the state.  
					</li></ul>
