				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<b><p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p></b>
				<p>The code I started with was the 2 examples from the lecture that was given for the ascii metaball art. I really wanted to do something relating to ascii art and I liked the mouse interaction so I decided to lean towards these two examples and imitate them.  </p>
				<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1098610">Ascii Meteballs by Joan Shin </a> and
				<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/Ne8is2yx7">Ascii Metaballs by Wes Modes</a>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<B><p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p></B>
				<p>I took the code that was originally created by Joan Shin called Ascii metaballs and then tried changing the shape and configuration of the ascii characters. I also tried to change the colors to make it more visually appealing rather than bland in black and white. I took Wesâ€™s version of this project and integrated the color choice but then innovated on it a bit. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<b><p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p></b>
				<p>After copying the base code and replicating the style I innovated on the visual aspects by creating a color palette that was appealing to the eye. This made it look truly unique compared to the original project. I also thought it would be interesting to create an explode and reset button so the user can have a bit more interaction. The explosion spawns a set number of particles in the middle and it creates another unique effect that the original code base could not do. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<b><p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p></b>
				<ul>
					<b><li>What part of the project you contributed</li></b>
					<ul>
						<li> All created by Lukas Licon with inspiration from the code linked <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1098610">here</a> and <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/Ne8is2yx7">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<b><li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li></b>
					<ul>
						<li>Overall, I am proud of my work but I wish I could have figured out how to change the shapes properly from circles to stars. I wanted to represent the clusters in different ways but instead just figured I could play around with how the clusters are manipulated in the end with things like an explosion of ascii characters. </li>
					</ul>
					<b><li>Brief highs and lows</li></b>
					<ul>
						<li>A brief low was when I couldn't figure out how to change the cluster shape into stars. The way the code was written was too hard to manipulate its moving shape into anything else than a cluster that looked like a circle. This was due to the movement and the characters not being perfectly precise using ascii. </li>
						<li>A brief high was once I stopped trying to use random colors for the characters and decided to make set colors that worked together as a palette. This made the art look tremendously better than my attempts with the random colors and instead made it look truly unique.</li>
