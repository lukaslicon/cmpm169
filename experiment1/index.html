				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<b><p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p></b>
				<p>The code I started with was from the generative design website provided. I looked into the code and used it as a starting point. I ended up scrapping a bunch of the aspects of it and simplifying the code so that there was only one object on the screen instead of 6 spanning across both directions.
					I also kept the part of the code where there is different inputs becuase I thought it was interesting to tackle different forms of the same art. I wanted to do this as well so the inputs for this page are 1 and 2 to switch between experiments.

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<B><p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p></B>
				<p>After thoroughly searching through the generative design ideas I decided I wanted to integrate aspects of random color and some sort of randomness to each aspect of this code I found. I thought it would be mesmerizing to make something that looked almost hypnotic. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<b><p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p></b>
				<p>I implemented random colors but it started to mess up quite a bit and almost looked to strobe like. It looked like a flashing light and i tweaked values and tried to make gradual changes in colors. After messing around with the color changing I realized it would be cooler looking to change the boarder colors rather than the inside colors. I tried to make each line individual change like as if 
					the color would be moving along the line changing through random colors. This did not work and I ultimately messed up and created a wave of changing colors where each line changed in a wave like manner. I ended up really liking this and sticking with it. I smoothed out the transitions and I really loved how it ended up looking when you interact with the diamond to move it.
	
				</p>
				<p>I then tried to implemt this a second time. If you hit 2 on the webpage it switches to another art interaction. This one moves/rotates the same as the other one but different objects are at play. I instead ignored the borders and used my old code where I was changing the inside color only. I made it so that it chooses random colors within a blue color pallet.
					These colors then fade away and it looks really cool to see them create different patterns depending on how you move your mouse and the position you leave it in. To go back to the first experiment you click 1.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<ul><li> All created by Lukas Licon with inspiration from the code linked <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_2_1_3_04">here</a>.</li></ul>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<ul><li>I love the work that I did and am surprised of the creativity that came from making mistakes and learning from them.</li></ul>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<ul><li>I had a low with some bugs for a bit that was causing no output but after some console log debugging I found the issue and was able to fix it after a couple of hours. </li>
					<li>
						I had a high when I messed up the logic in my code but it ended up very cool looking so I kept it and was excited that my failure led to something interesting and unique.
					</li></ul>
