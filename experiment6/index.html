				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<b><p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p></b>
				<p>The code I started with was the 2 example listed below. The first is an article I read that helped me understand heatmaps and how they represent data. The second is an example of a heatmap being created. But overall I used the first article as a main point of guidance.</p>
				<a href="https://www.anychart.com/blog/2020/02/26/heat-map-chart-create-javascript/">Heatmap Example 1</a> and
				<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Kubi/sketches/TJf0zzLR7">Heatmap Example 2</a>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>I never extended the code instead I just created my own heatmap from scratch and used the article as a starting point to guide my learning and understanding. I mainly used ChatGPT to guide my learning and understand each step of the process so I could manipulate the heatmap a little bit and change it uniquely. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>I created something truly unique in this code by taking a dataset from Kaggle and importing it into my code. I used this dataset of all of IGNâ€™s best to worst ranked games and created a random heatmap that displays 100 random of these games. I then randomized the location and added titles so that it generated a random layout of games each time with different colors everywhere. The colors (heat) of the squares are depending on the score of the game. I also made it a bit unique by changing the hue, saturation, and lightness of the squares so that they were out of a regular color scheme to create an interesting look to the art. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<b><p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p></b>
				<ul>
					<b><li>What part of the project you contributed</li></b>
					<ul>
						<li> All created by Lukas Licon with help/inspiration from the code linked <a href="https://www.anychart.com/blog/2020/02/26/heat-map-chart-create-javascript/">here</a></a> and <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Kubi/sketches/TJf0zzLR7">here</a></a></li>
					</ul>
					<b><li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li></b>
					<ul>
						<li>Overall, I am proud of my work and I learned a lot about heatmaps</li>
					</ul>
					<b><li>Brief highs and lows</li></b>
					<ul>
						<li>A brief low was when I couldn't figure out how to change the amount of data being displayed on the heatmap but instead I just did a randomization where it showed random games and I thought this was more fun to sit there and look through all the IGN game scores. </li>
						<li>A brief high was once i figured out how to make the heatmap different colors it made it look a lot more interesting because I had it stuck varying between 2 colors at first and it was a super boring heatmap.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<P>This code generates a random heatmap visualization where each square represents a video game, displaying its title and score, with colors indicating the score's intensity.</P>
