				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<b><p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p></b>
				<p>The code I started with was from a website about audio visualization in JavaScript with p5.js. I looked into the code and used it as a starting point. 
				</p>
				<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Ruyi_Chen/sketches/H1UJM_0nQ">Code Link Here</a>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<B><p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p></B>
				<p>I tried to integrate the same style from the code of taking the spectrum length but instead I wanted to represent it differently and play around with what I could do/make it look like.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<b><p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p></b>
				<p>I pretty much changed the code completely trying to smooth out the bar movement and making everything fully based on spectrum. I had it choose the color based on spectrum an the length of the bars based on the spectrum as well. This makes it so that whatever song is uploaded there will be a visual representation based on the sound.</p>
				<p>I also wanted to make some other form of visual representation so I did particle explosions that are randomly on the screen based on the spectrum ranges as well. The lower bass like notes will cause explosions and then they will be colored red or blue based on the spectrum. </p>
				<p> I also made it so that it can take .MP3, .WAV, .OGG </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<b><p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p></b>
				<ul>
					<b><li>What part of the project you contributed</li></b>
					<ul><li> All created by Lukas Licon with inspiration from the code linked <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Ruyi_Chen/sketches/H1UJM_0nQ">here</a>.</li></ul>
					<b><li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li></b>
					<ul><li>I love the work that I did and im happy I put extra time to learn more about visualizers because our group is going to make a cool one for our final project.</li></ul>
					<b><li>Brief highs and lows</li></b>
					<ul><li>I had a low when i added in particles. There were way too many explosions I had to limit it to a certain portion of the spectrum so that it only made it explosions for bass like sounds.</li>
					<li>
						The whole project felt like a high after I was able to upload individual songs and change the visualizer each time. 
					</li></ul>
